# ByteBattles with Ather Energy: 30 Hours, One EV & a Lot of Coffee

> *“When was the last time you coded on a real electric vehicle?”*  
> – Probably never. Until ByteBattles.

## What is ByteBattles?
**ByteBattles** is a national-level firmware hackathon hosted by [Ather Energy](https://www.atherenergy.com/), inviting students and professionals from across India to tackle real-world challenges in the EV (Electric Vehicle) space.

Participants were challenged to develop firmware solutions for the **Ather 450x**, a flagship electric scooter—and yes, we were actually given the scooter to code on.

## Pune to Bangalore: The Journey Begins
- **3:00 AM**: Flight from Pune
- **8:00 AM**: Land in Bangalore and reach Ather HQ
- **8:30 AM**: Check-in, breakfast, orientation
- Swag secured: T-shirts + ID cards
- Office tour: Our base for the next 30 hours
We were five caffeine-powered engineers, barely awake but buzzing with excitement.

## The Problem Statement

At the orientation, we were introduced to the real challenge:  
> Implement **7 firmware features** on the Ather 450x over the weekend.

With access to development boards, firmware libraries, and the Ather 450x, we were off to a flying start. Kind of.

---
## Hack Mode: ON
- **11:00 AM**: Coding begins  
- Problem 1 solved in 10 mins—*or so we thought*
- Turns out... it was a faulty **USB cable**

While the volunteers helped debug the hardware, we brainstormed and coded two more features—with no working hardware in hand. Grit.

### Debug, Debug, Repeat

- Two team members: Locked into debugging mode  
- Rest of us: Shipping code like our lives depended on it  
- **Result**: 4 features implemented by the end of the round

But we missed the early submission points—by **just a few minutes**. That sealed our fate: we didn’t make it to **Phase 2**.

---
## Phase 2: Watching from the Sidelines

While the top 15 teams moved upstairs to tackle advanced problem statements, we made the most of our time:

- Networked with students & working pros
- Interactive Q&As with Ather engineers
- Explored stripped-down Ather 450x models
- Activities: Dumb charades, music, DJ, even a mystery guitar jam session

## Night Mode: Floor is the New Bed

By 3 AM, the office had turned into a co-living space:

- Bean bags, sleeping bags, and even just floors
- Brain fog, but hearts still racing with excitement

---

## The Plot Twist

The next morning, we got another shot at accessing our EV.

> **30 minutes later**, we solved the bug that had blocked us the entire day before.  
> In one shot, **3 additional features** started working.

Talk about tragic timing.

## Final Takeaways

Despite not making it to the final round, ByteBattles was:

- A rare opportunity to work with **real EV hardware**
- Our first hands-on experience with **firmware development**
- A brilliant space to **network** with passionate engineers
- A steep learning curve that pushed all our boundaries
