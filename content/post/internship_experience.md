## ⏳ Tackling Frustration with a Wait State Loader

### 🔍 The Problem

Long image processing times were leading to:
- User frustration and app abandonment
- Confusion among new users trying to understand text-to-image generation
- Lost opportunities to highlight community creativity

### 💡 The Solution

Introduce a **wait state loader** that:
- Shows community-generated images
- Displays prompts used to create them
- Lets users **copy prompts** for inspiration while they wait

### ⚙️ What I Built

✅ An **automated image slider** that:
- Pulls in community images from a remote server  
- Displays them with clean, styled captions  
- Allows quick **one-tap prompt copying**
