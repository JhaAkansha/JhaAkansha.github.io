# My Internship Experience at Adobe

> *"A dream internship, real-world impact, and a journey into the heart of creativity and innovation."*

Landing an internship at **Adobe** was nothing short of surreal. It was a thrilling and unexpected milestone, and I couldn’t wait to see what life beyond the classroom looked like—working alongside industry veterans and building features that millions might use.

## Team Photoshop Express – Android Squad

I joined the **Photoshop Express** team, where I primarily worked on the **Android app**. What amazed me from day one was the ownership I was given. I wasn't just there to shadow someone—I was contributing to **real features** that impacted actual users.

## Tackling Frustration with a Wait State Loader
### The Problem
Long image processing times were leading to:
- User frustration and app abandonment
- Confusion among new users trying to understand text-to-image generation
- Lost opportunities to highlight community creativity

### The Solution
Introduce a **wait state loader** that:
- Shows community-generated images
- Displays prompts used to create them
- Lets users **copy prompts** for inspiration while they wait

### What I Built
An **automated image slider** that:
- Pulls in community images from a remote server  
- Displays them with clean, styled captions  
- Allows quick **one-tap prompt copying**

## Leading the Generative Expand Feature

> *"From concept to production—owning one of the most powerful AI-driven features in the app."*

### What is Generative Expand?

**Generative Expand** is an innovative feature that allows users to change the **aspect ratio of an image** by using **AI** to seamlessly generate and fill in the extended canvas based on the original content.

> Imagine expanding a photo horizontally, and the app fills in the sides with realistic, context-aware details—**automatically**.

---

### My Role

I was entrusted with **end-to-end ownership** of this feature during my internship, and it quickly became the most exciting and challenging part of my journey.

#### Responsibilities:
- Architected the workflow for **canvas resizing** + **AI content generation**
- Integrated Firefly model capabilities into the Android app
- Ensured a **smooth and intuitive UX**, minimizing user friction
- Collaborated with designers, QA, and product teams for polish

---

### Timeline & Execution

- **3 weeks of development**  
- Continuous feedback and iteration with mentors  
- Meticulous testing across devices and screen sizes  
- Final implementation went **live** in the production app

Seeing my feature **shipped and used by real users** was one of the most fulfilling moments of the internship.

## Enhancing the Firefly Model through Prompt Engineering

> *"The art of talking to AI—shaping how it sees, creates, and imagines."*

One of the most intellectually rewarding parts of my internship involved working on **Prompt Engineering** for Adobe’s **Firefly model**, which powers several upcoming features in the **Photoshop Express iOS app**.

---

### The Challenge

The Firefly model needed smarter, trend-aware inputs to produce cleaner, more realistic images. That meant:
- Reducing visual **noise**
- Avoiding **confusing or ambiguous prompts**
- Keeping up with rapidly evolving **creative trends**

---

### What I Did

As a Prompt Engineer, my responsibilities included:

- **Refining** existing prompts to improve clarity and output quality  
- **Creating new prompt categories** based on trend analysis  
- **Cleaning up** noisy or redundant text elements  
- Studying competitor apps + user-generated galleries for inspiration

This wasn’t just a technical task—it was part research, part design thinking, and part creative strategy.

---

### The Results

The model produced **cleaner, more accurate, and visually appealing images**  
New prompt categories helped Firefly stay **aligned with creative trends**  
Prompt templates became more **user-friendly and intuitive**

> I wasn’t just teaching AI how to create—I was helping it create better.

## Wrapping It All Up

### Conclusion

My internship at **Adobe** was a **transformative journey**. I got to:

- Build **real features** that shipped to production  
- Work hands-on with **AI-driven technologies**  
- Contribute directly to **Photoshop Express** on Android and iOS  
- Collaborate with an incredibly talented and welcoming team  

It was the perfect blend of **challenge**, **creativity**, and **real-world impact**.

> I walked in as a student curious about how the industry works—and walked out as a developer who's contributed to one of the most recognized creative platforms in the world.
