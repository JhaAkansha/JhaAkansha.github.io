Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. It is built on top of Hadoop Map Reduce module. It extends MapReduce module to efficiently use more types of computation interactive queries and stream processing.
It has its own cluster management. It utilizes Hadoop in two ways: storage and processing. It helps run an application in a Hadoop cluster, multiple times faster in memory. This happens due to reduced number of read/write operations to disk.
