ByteBattles is an all india firmware hackathon organized by Ather Energy where the bring together engineers to come up with innovative solutions to their problem statement related to issues faced by the EV development community.
There was first an eliminatory round where we had to submit an arduino code for LED lights.
The final round was held in their Bangalore office and it was a 30-hour hackathon that was divided into 2 phases and went on for the entire weekend.
We were a team of five coming from Pune. We took a 3 am flight to Bangalore and made it to the office around 8, 30 minutes before the reporting time. We completed our registration, got our ids and t-shirt. We were first shown around to get a glimpse of the office and where to go to get whatever we wanted, considering it was  going to be our home for the next 2 days. We had breakfast and were ready for the orientation, our enthusiasm was high and sleep was elusive. Then, we were explained the problem statement. There were around 7 features we were required to add to the Ather 450x we were given.
Finally, at around 11 am, we were all geared up to code away. THe submission time was 4 pm. We brainstormed and were able to code the first problem statement within the first 10 minutes. We flashed the code to the hardware and alas it didn't work. After seeking some help from the Ather volunteers, we realised there was some issue with the cable. While the issue was being solved, we brainstormed over the other problem statements.
By the time the problem was solved, we had tackled tow more problems to the best of our abilities without any firmware available.
Obviously, we ran into some logical errors that we realised after flashing the code to the EV. We had two people working on debugging while the rest worked on the code.
Time trickled away and with around 2 hours left, we were done with the code but faced problems debugging. AFter 2 hours of debugging, we were able to get 4 things off the checklist. The solution to others remained elusive to us.
We had lunch and waited for the results as phase 1 came to an end.
Since we spent so long trying to make the code work, which it didn't, we lost the extra point we would have gotten for submitting early, which were all the points we needed to make it to the next round so that was unfortunate for us.
The next phase brought on more advanced problem staements. The fifteen teams that made it to phase 2 worked on those on the first floor where there was an entire set up for them. THe rest of us remained where we were and networked with other competitors, which included people in the workforce since this competition was open to both, students and working peofessionals. We also chatted with the volunteers from Ather.
