Databending is the artistic misuse of digital information. It draws its name from the practice of circuit bending -- a practice where childrens' toys, cheap keyboards and effects pedals are deliberately short-circuited by bending the circuit board to generate spontaneous and unpredictable sounds. Databending takes a similar approach to circuit bending, using software to intentionally disrupt the information contained within a file. There's all kinds of different techniques, some involving deep hex editing of certain parts of a compression algorithm, but other methods are surprisingly simple. A hex editor (or binary file editor or byte editor) is a computer program that allows for manipulation of the fundamental binary data that constitutes a computer file.
    As technology becomes more complex, more glitches occur. A new term, "glitch art" has been coined for these glitches. An increasing number of artists have started to value these glitches and have come to insert them intentionally in whatever they are trying to create though many argue that the term glitch art can only be used for glitches that are unintentional.
The different techniques of databending can broadly be divided into three categories:
1. Incorrect editing: In incorrect editing, a file is edited using software intended for a different type of data.
2. Reinterpretation: Reinterpretation is where a file is converted from one medium to another.
3. Field of forced errors: In this type of databending known bugs in programs are exploited to force them to fail, usually while writing a file in the hope that the written file will be corrupted.
