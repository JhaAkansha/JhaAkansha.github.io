Getting an internship at Adobe was a very unexpected but welcome change for me, it was a stepping stone towards my career goals. I could not wait to go to corporate and see how things work, see how different things are and embrace challening tasks. I was a part of the Photoshop Express team and mainly worked on the android app.
I started by creating a wait state loader. This wait state loader was required to tackle the following problems:
1. Longer wait times lead to increased user frustration and result in higher exit rates.
2. New users often lack adequate guidance on effective prompts for text-to-image generation, leading to suboptimal experiences and disengagement.
3. Providing access to community-generated content can foster a sense of connection and engagement, demonstrating the platform's capabilities and encouraging continued use.
4. Goal: Introduce a wait state loader that showcases community-generated images and allows users to view, and copy prompts for inspiration during processing delays.

My biggest task was taking feature ownership of the Generative Expand feature. It took me 3 weeks to deliver it. It got shipped into the app for everyone and I had the ability to pull it out and show it to anyone wondering what I do. It was felt amazing, that feeling of having something to show for after all the efforts you put it.
Another task I did was to perform Prompt Engineering for the Firefly model to be used for the upcoming features of the Photoshop Express iOS app. My job was to look into competitor apps and community gallery to find what is popular and produce additional prompts and categories as well as Work on prompts already present and alter them to get better results.
 I successfully enhanced existing prompts to minimize image noise and produce more realistic visual outputs, Developed new categories that are currently trending and cleaned prompts to reduce unnecessary information provided which can confuse AI.
