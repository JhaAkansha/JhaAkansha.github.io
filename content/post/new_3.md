# My Internship Experience at Adobe

Landing an internship at Adobe was a thrilling and unexpected milestone for me. It was a major stepping stone toward my long-term career goals, and I couldn’t wait to dive into the corporate world to see how everything operated, discover how things differed from academia, and embrace challenging tasks.

I had the incredible opportunity to join the **Photoshop Express** team, where I primarily worked on the Android app. Right from the start, I was tasked with making significant contributions that would have a direct impact on user experience.

## Tackling Frustration with a Wait State Loader

My first major task was creating a **wait state loader**. It might sound simple, but it addressed several key problems:
1. **Long wait times** lead to user frustration and higher exit rates.
2. **New users** often struggled with text-to-image prompts, leading to suboptimal experiences.
3. **Community content** can boost user engagement, showcasing the platform’s potential.

The goal was to introduce a feature that showcased community-generated images while users waited, allowing them to view and copy prompts for inspiration during processing delays.

By the end of the project, I had successfully built an **automated image slider**. It displayed community images hosted remotely, along with captions showing the prompts used to generate them. Users could easily copy these prompts, giving them a sense of connection and inspiration as they waited for their own images to process.

## Leading the **Generative Expand** Feature

The most exciting part of my internship came when I was entrusted with the **Generative Expand feature**. This innovative feature enabled users to adjust the aspect ratio of an image by using AI to intelligently fill in the additional space, based on the image’s context.

Taking ownership of this feature was a monumental responsibility. I spent three weeks diligently working on it, perfecting every detail to ensure it provided a seamless experience. When it was finally launched, I was beyond proud to see my work shipped out into the app and available to everyone. It was an incredibly satisfying feeling to know that my contribution was now something tangible, something I could proudly show off to anyone curious about my work.

## Enhancing the Firefly Model through Prompt Engineering

Another key project I worked on was **Prompt Engineering** for the **Firefly model**, which was going to be used for upcoming features in the **Photoshop Express iOS app**. This task required me to closely analyze competitor apps and community galleries to identify popular trends, and then create additional prompts and categories to enhance the model’s output.

My job was to:
- Refine and optimize existing prompts to reduce image noise and generate more realistic visuals.
- Develop **new categories** to stay ahead of trends and user preferences.
- Clean up prompts to remove extraneous information that could confuse the AI.

The result? I successfully **enhanced** the model’s ability to produce high-quality, visually appealing results, all while minimizing the risk of poor or incoherent images. I also created new categories that aligned with emerging trends, ensuring the app remained at the cutting edge of user experience.

## Conclusion

Overall, my internship at Adobe was a transformative experience. I had the chance to work on impactful features that are now part of the everyday user experience, and I developed new skills that will serve me well throughout my career. The work was challenging but immensely rewarding, and it was a privilege to contribute to such a well-known and respected company.
