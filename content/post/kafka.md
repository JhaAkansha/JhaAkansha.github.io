# Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform. It has a publish-subscribe messaging system which allows exchanging of data between applications, servers and processors as well. Kafka is written in Java and Scala. It is scalable and fault-tolerant and has topic-based partition FIFO queues.

## Why Apache Kafka
1. **High Throughput**: Deliver messages at network limited throughput using a cluster of machines with latencies as low as 2ms.
2. **Scalable**: Scale production clusters up to a thousand brokers, trillions of messages per day, petabytes of data, hundreds of thousands of partitions. Elastically expand and contract storage and processing.
3. **Permanent Storage**: Store streams of data safely in distributed, durable, fault-tolerant cluster.
