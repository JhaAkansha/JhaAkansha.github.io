Hey there! I'm a curious coder fueled by coffee, books, and a never-ending playlist. I'm completed my B.Tech at Cummins College of Engineering in Pune, with a growing passion for all things tech.

In summer 2023, I got my hands dirty with React as a trainee developer at TechWalnut, and in summer 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a Product Intern at Adobe. Currently I am a Member of Technical Staff (SDE1) at Adobe in Bangalore.

I love learning, building, and exploring new technologies—always on the lookout for the next project or problem to dive into. Thanks for choosing to read my blog out of all the blogs out there!
